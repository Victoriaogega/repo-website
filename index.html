    <p>My first week at AkiraChix was very exciting and intresting.I learnt so many things and
        different cultures.I got to know how to do first aid and that there are different types of fire extinguishers
        depending on the type of fuel being burnt.I also learnt that Ethiopia is in the year 2017 and that the
        Ethiopians fast twice a week,on Wednesday and on Friday.Their fasting involves abstaining from animal products
        and not food. That was fascinating to me.<br>I ejoyed the warm shower and the clean bedding too.I made new
        friends and i also learned how to play foosbal(the table football) and now it is my favourite thing to do.<br>
